## Basic terminology 

* **File system:** collection of files 
* **Current directory:** CD is the current directory where you are right now
* **parent directory:** current directory and the parent for sub directories
* **the difference between your home directory and the home directory:** the home directory in linux is the root which is the admin or head of the system and my home directory is the same thing but it is a user 
* **pathname:** name of a file
* **relative path:** describing the location of the file 
* **absolute path:**specifying the location of the file and narrowing it down
