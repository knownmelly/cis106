## Basic Terminology


### What is a web server?
Web servers have two sides a software and hardware side. Software stores files from the website and server and also including the hosted files from host. Hardware is connected to wifi and allows to transfer information to other connected devices.


### What are some different web server applications?

| Application Name   | License               | Website                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Lighttpd fly light | BSD License           | (https://www.lighttpd.net)      |
| CaddyServer        | Apache License 2.0    | (https://caddyserver.com)       |
| Lite speed tech    | Group Common Licenses | (https://www.litespeedtech.com) |

Lighttpd (pronounced /lighty/) is a secure, fast, compliant, and very flexible web server that has been optimized for high-performance environments. lighttpd uses memory and CPU efficiently and has lower resource use than other popular web servers.

![logo caddy](caddy.webp)<br>

CaddyServer: crave simplicity and are put off by the obtuse configurations of the likes of Apache and Nginx, Caddy will feel like a breeze of fresh air. That said, it works best when youâ€™re happy with the defaults. For instance, if you want to use your SSL provider, have a separate directory for static files (which is almost always the case), and so on, the advantages fade away.

OpenLiteSpeed: is the Open Source edition of LiteSpeed Web Server Enterprise.
Both servers are actively developed and maintained by the same team, and are held to the same high-quality coding standard.


### What is Virtualization?

Creating a virtual version of something that can be broken without harming hardware.

### What is virtualbox?

### What is a firewall?

blocking unauthorized communications that can hard computers like a virus

### What is SSH?

## Other Relvent Concepts

##### 1.) how do you remove a file then get it back?

##### 2.) what does grep do and need an example?

##### 3.) how do you remove a program fully?
