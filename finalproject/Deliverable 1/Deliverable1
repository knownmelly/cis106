If you crave simplicity and are put off by the obtuse configurations of the likes of Apache and Nginx, Caddy will feel like a breeze of fresh air. That said, it works best when youâ€™re happy with the defaults. For instance, if you want to use your SSL provider, have a separate directory for static files (which is almost always the case), and so on, the advantages fade away.

OpenLiteSpeed is the Open Source edition of LiteSpeed Web Server Enterprise.
Both servers are actively developed and maintained by the same team, and are held to the same high-quality coding standard.
